# Realtime-Chat-Application
The server-side functionality of Node.js is used combined with the Socket.IO package to construct a real-time chat application. Web clients and servers can communicate in real-time, in both directions, thanks to the JavaScript framework known as Socket.IO.

Steps to follow:
1) Start a new Node.js project with npm and create a new folder for it.
2) Create the server-side code
3) Write the client-side code
4) Use node server.js to start the server or a programme like nodemon to have the server restart itself if something changes.
5) To access the chat application, launch a web browser and navigate to the proper URL (for example, localhost:8000).

The application can be opened by multiple users at once, and messages can be sent.
The server will manage the clients' real-time communication, allowing them to send and receive messages instantly.
